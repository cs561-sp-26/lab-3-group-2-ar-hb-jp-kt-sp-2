![Gthub screenshot displaying Shivani Merge Conflict When merging to main](Shivani_Merge_Conflict.png)

In this branch, I encountered a merge conflict when merging the `feature/mode-tabs` branch into the `main` branch. The conflict occurred in the `branch-feature-modetabs-readme.md` file on lines 11-36, 45, 55, 66 and 86-98. I resolved the conflict by keeping the changes from both branches and modifying the code to work together. The commit ID for this merge is `3456789`.

### Rebase Description 
In this branch, I rebased the `feature/mode-tabs` branch onto the `main` branch. The commit ID for this rebase is `a0ade2`. This is because the main was ahead of my commit HEAD and I rebased to get to the latest commit.

### Cherry Pick Description
I cherry-picked the commit `ae63983d` from the `feature/mode-tabs` branch into the `main` branch. The commit populated the skeleton code structure for document.js needed for modeTabs feature integration. I resolved conflicts conflicts that arose during the cherry-pick process by removing the `branch-feature-modetabs-readme.md` file that was not yet available in the `main` branch but will go in later as part of a pull request.

In this branch, I cherry-picked the commit `a05b8fd` from the `main` branch into the `feature/mode-tabs` branch.
